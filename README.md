# AWSforGPU

This repo just covers instructions for getting an aws server up and running with GPU enabled Tensorflow/Keras for deep learning. <br>

While the specific links may be out of date, the process should work. <br>
Quick caveat, the Keras one is older when I first started on this grand adventure and might a be a little off on the configuration. The Tensorflow has a much better guide for installing the CUDA/cuDNN.
