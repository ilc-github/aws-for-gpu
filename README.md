# AWSforGPU

This repo just covers instructions for getting an aws server up and running with GPU enabled Tensorflow/Keras for deep learning. <br>

While the specific links may be out of date, the process should work. <br>
The tensorflow guide instructions for setting up the CUDA/CuDNN drivers should hold true for Keras/Theano as well. The difference will come from which version of CUDA/CuDNN versions to select as well as configuring Keras to use the GPU.
