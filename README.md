# AWSforGPU

This repo just covers instructions for getting an aws server up and running with GPU enabled Tensorflow/Keras for deep learning. <br>

While the specific links may be out of date, the process should work. <br>
There's a quick caveat that the Tensorflow one is more current than the Keras one, and the CUDA/cuDNN instruction guides are probably more up to date.
